Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

**Example 2:**

**Example 3:**

Input: "pwwkew"

             Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

## Analysis

看了下题目，举了三个例子，初步理解为：输入的字符串，得到一个子字符串长度，子字符串满足一个条件子字符串是原字符串的完整子集，并且子字符串中间没有重复的字符。

首先要考虑用什么数据结构存储字符串，然而一头莫展。
