# 13. Roman to Integer

## Question

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
For example, two is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. Twelve is written as, XII, which is simply X + II. The number twenty seven is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.
C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer. Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.

Example 1:

Input: "III"
Output: 3

Example 2:

Input: "IV"
Output: 4

Example 3:

Input: "IX"
Output: 9

Example 4:

Input: "LVIII"
Output: 58
Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.

Example 5:

Input: "MCMXCIV"
Output: 1994
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.

## Anaylsis

罗马数字转换为整形数字，对应的有I、V、X、L、C、D、M，1、5、10、50、100、500、1000，通过题目举的例子可以看出来，罗马数字：从左至右，从大到小表达。同时，小的在大的左边的时候，相应的做减法，在右边的时候，相应的做加法。对字符串进行判断，并对连续两个同时进行判断，如果左<右那么做减法，否则做加法。

## Answer

```python
# -*- coding:UTF-8 -*-

def RomanToInteger(s):
    le = len(s)
    R = {"I":1,"V":5,"X":10,"L":50,"C":100,"D":500,"M":1000}
    result = 0
    i=0
    while(i<le):
        l = s[i]
        if i+1 == le:
            result = result + R[l]
            break
        r = s[i+1]
        if(R[l] < R[r]):
            result = result + R[r] -R[l]
            i=i+2
        else:
            result = result + R[l]
            i = i+1
    return result


if __name__ == '__main__':
    x = "D"
    print(RomanToInteger(x))
```

## Summary

总结一下，数据结构采用字典和数组，利用字典来使罗马数字和整数对应起来，利用数组移动角标判断相邻两个罗马字做加法还是减法，顺便判断结尾。数组的运用还是不够熟练，在设计`while`循环条件的时候，对于是用`i < len-1`还是`i < len`的时候，经过了多次测试才弄明白，另外在判断下下一个字符的时候没有提前考虑越界溢出的问题，So在`r = s[i]`之前添加了if和break判断语句，防止发生数组指针溢出。
